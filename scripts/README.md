# Overview
This repository features a mixture of R scripts and Quarto markdowns (based on personal preference of lead coder for that project section). The order to run the files in can be found below. Where relevant, the scripts feature a `base_path` variable that can be changed based on the location of the project on your local machine. This is the first thing to check if "file exists" or "path" errors occur during running.
