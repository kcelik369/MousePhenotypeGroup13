# Overview
The intermediate files in this folder were generated by the functions in the `Data_merging_and_cleaning_script.R` script, which identifies invalid values based on the SOP. For each instance of invalid data, the script produces a CSV file where the values are replaced with `NA` along with a corresponding Excel file that highlights the modified cells in red for manual review and verification.
